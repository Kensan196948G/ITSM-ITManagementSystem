# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment (Batchtools Optimized)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### 🔴 MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
```

### 🎯 CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:
- ✅ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## Project Overview

npx claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create authentication flow pseudocode" --batch-optimize
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Process multiple algorithm patterns concurrently, validate logic flows in parallel, and optimize data structures simultaneously.

### 3. Architecture Phase (Parallel Component Design)
```bash
# Design system architecture with concurrent component analysis
npx claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication service architecture" --parallel
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Generate multiple architectural alternatives simultaneously, validate integration points in parallel, and create comprehensive documentation concurrently.

### 4. Refinement Phase (Parallel TDD Implementation)
```bash
# Execute Test-Driven Development with parallel test generation
npx claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication system" --batch-tdd
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Generate multiple test scenarios simultaneously, implement and validate code in parallel, and optimize performance concurrently.

### 5. Completion Phase (Concurrent Integration)
```bash
# Integration with parallel validation and documentation
npx claude-flow sparc run integration "integrate authentication with user management" --parallel
```
**Batchtools Optimization**: Run integration tests in parallel, generate documentation concurrently, and validate requirements simultaneously.

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Claude Code Does ALL Real Work

### 🎯 CLAUDE CODE IS THE ONLY EXECUTOR

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Claude Code performs ALL actual work:

### ✅ Claude Code ALWAYS Handles:

- 🔧 **ALL file operations** (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- 💻 **ALL code generation** and programming tasks
- 🖥️ **ALL bash commands** and system operations
- 🏗️ **ALL actual implementation** work
- 🔍 **ALL project navigation** and code analysis
- 📝 **ALL TodoWrite** and task management
- 🔄 **ALL git operations** (commit, push, merge)
- 📦 **ALL package management** (npm, pip, etc.)
- 🧪 **ALL testing** and validation
- 🔧 **ALL debugging** and troubleshooting

### 🧠 Claude Flow MCP Tools ONLY Handle:

- 🎯 **Coordination only** - Planning Claude Code's actions
- 💾 **Memory management** - Storing decisions and context
- 🤖 **Neural features** - Learning from Claude Code's work
- 📊 **Performance tracking** - Monitoring Claude Code's efficiency
- 🐝 **Swarm orchestration** - Coordinating multiple Claude Code instances
- 🔗 **GitHub integration** - Advanced repository coordination

### 🚨 CRITICAL SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:

**❌ MCP Tools NEVER:**

- Write files or create content
- Execute bash commands
- Generate code
- Perform file operations
- Handle TodoWrite operations
- Execute system commands
- Do actual implementation work

**✅ MCP Tools ONLY:**

- Coordinate and plan
- Store memory and context
- Track performance
- Orchestrate workflows
- Provide intelligence insights

### ⚠️ Key Principle:

**MCP tools coordinate, Claude Code executes.** Think of MCP tools as the "brain" that plans and coordinates, while Claude Code is the "hands" that do all the actual work.

### 🔄 WORKFLOW EXECUTION PATTERN:

**✅ CORRECT Workflow:**

1. **MCP**: `mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init` (coordination setup)
2. **MCP**: `mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn` (planning agents)
3. **MCP**: `mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate` (task coordination)
4. **Claude Code**: `Task` tool to spawn agents with coordination instructions
5. **Claude Code**: `TodoWrite` with ALL todos batched (5-10+ in ONE call)
6. **Claude Code**: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash` (actual work)
7. **MCP**: `mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage` (store results)

**❌ WRONG Workflow:**

1. **MCP**: `mcp__claude-flow__terminal_execute` (DON'T DO THIS)
2. **MCP**: File creation via MCP (DON'T DO THIS)
3. **MCP**: Code generation via MCP (DON'T DO THIS)
4. **Claude Code**: Sequential Task calls (DON'T DO THIS)
5. **Claude Code**: Individual TodoWrite calls (DON'T DO THIS)

### 🚨 REMEMBER:

- **MCP tools** = Coordination, planning, memory, intelligence
- **Claude Code** = All actual execution, coding, file operations
